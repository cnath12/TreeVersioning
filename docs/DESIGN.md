# Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

## Data Model Design
- Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for database abstraction
- Separate tables for Trees, Nodes, Edges, and Tags
- JSON storage for flexible configuration data

### Tradeoffs:

1. SQL vs NoSQL
- Chose SQL for ACID properties and relationship management
- Sacrificed some flexibility for data consistency
- SQL better suits our hierarchical data structure and versioning needs

2. Data Storage
- JSON in SQL for configuration data
- Pro: Flexible schema
- Con: Limited query capabilities within JSON
- Future PostgreSQL migration would enable better JSON querying with JSONB

3. Version Control
- Full copy approach for versions
- Pro: Simple and reliable
- Con: Storage space overhead
- Future optimization: Consider delta-based versioning for large trees

4. Tag System
- Lightweight references to tree states
- Pro: Easy rollback and reference
- Con: Extra storage for metadata

## Database Choice

### Current: SQLite
- Pros:
  - Simple setup and zero configuration
  - Single file storage makes it portable
  - Perfect for development and testing
  - Good for single-user scenarios
  - Built-in transaction support
- Cons:
  - Limited concurrent access
  - Basic JSON support
  - No built-in replication
  - Not suitable for high-traffic production

### Future: PostgreSQL
- Benefits of migration:
  - Better concurrent access handling
  - Advanced JSONB support for configuration data
  - Better performance for large datasets
  - Built-in replication and backup features
  - Connection pooling
  - Full-text search capabilities
- Migration considerations:
  - Will require connection pool management
  - Need to update indexes for JSONB
  - May need to optimize queries for PostgreSQL
  - Consider partitioning for large trees

## Performance Considerations
- Indexed foreign keys for faster joins
- Optimized queries for common operations
- Session management for concurrency
- Careful transaction handling
- Future optimizations:
  - Query caching
  - Result set pagination
  - Lazy loading for large trees

## Scalability
- Current design supports small to medium deployments
- PostgreSQL migration path for larger scale
- Possible sharding strategy for very large trees
- Consider caching layer for read-heavy workloads

## Extensibility
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Easy to add new features
- Database-agnostic through SQLAlchemy
- Extension points:
  - Custom node types
  - Additional metadata
  - Version control strategies
  - Custom traversal algorithms

## Security Considerations
- SQL injection prevention through ORM
- Transaction isolation
- Future enhancements:
  - Row-level security (PostgreSQL)
  - Audit logging
  - Access control integration

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- SQLite: Simple backup through file copy
- PostgreSQL advantages:
  - Built-in monitoring tools
  - Performance analysis
  - Query planning
  - Connection monitoring

## Development and Testing
- SQLite ideal for development cycle:
  - Quick setup
  - In-memory testing
  - Easy reset and cleanup
  - No external dependencies

## Future Enhancements
1. Query Optimization
   - Materialized paths for better traversal
   - Nested set model for hierarchical queries
   - Custom indexing strategies

2. Advanced Features
   - Diff generation between versions
   - Merge capabilities for branches
   - Conflict resolution
   - Automated cleanup of old versions

3. Operational Features
   - Backup and restore
   - Version archiving
   - Performance monitoring
   - Health checks
